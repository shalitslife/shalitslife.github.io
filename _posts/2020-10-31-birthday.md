Happy Birthday Shalit!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tomorrow would have been Shalit’s birthday. So, we’ve compiled every video of his we could and put them on a website for everyone to see.<br><br>Visit ( <a href="https://t.co/lCiyds9pL5">https://t.co/lCiyds9pL5</a> ) to re-watch some of your favorite content from the man himself.

After Matt posted this, many Groypers stepped up to contribute to the archive. There is now [a stream from 4/20](https://shalits.life/whitepilled), the night Trump announced he would be banning immigrants, [more streams from ShalitPAC](https://shalits.life/shalitpac), streams with the [Groypcast](https://shalits.life/groypcast/), and more [memes/photos/tweets](https://shalits.life/misc).

If you have any his streams that are not here, you can email `shalitslife@protonmail.com` and I will have them uploaded to this site / archive.
